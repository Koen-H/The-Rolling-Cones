# The Rolling Cones
In The Rolling Cones you play as a pinecone, use your round bottom half and rough top half to conquer the snowy areas and return the treasures you lost! 

You will have access to a number of items, but beware! You can only use these items in the designated areas, so use them wisely.

Once you have finished the game for the first time you can re-play it again using the golden play button to try and complete each level in new and faster ways.
